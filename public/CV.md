# Emil Broman

## Software Engineering Consultant

Active since late 2014, I'm an experienced developer with a professional, pragmatic,
and passionate approach to software design.

As a self-taught programmer since childhood, I have fostered a curiosity for all kinds
of programming, ranging from an original interest in graphic design and UI, all the way
across the stack to systems programming and compiler implementation.

## Experience (reverse chronological order)

### 2022–present: [Emil Broman AB](https://emilbroman.me) – My own consultancy company

I finally took the plunge and started my own business at the very end of 2021, and has
since worked with [Mevisio](https://mevisio.com), a highly customizable, highly
configurable, SaaS product that allows users to tailor interactive screens to their
unique workflows.

Working across the full stack as one of only a few developers, I worked with front-end,
back-end, devops, and infrastructure. Technologies and languages used include TypeScript,
Node.js, React, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Terraform, AWS.

### 2019-2021: [EQT](https://eqtgroup.com) – Sweden's largest Private Equity firm

At EQT, I worked on EQT's proprietary AI/Big Data analysis platform called _Motherbrain_.
Motherbrain ingests enormous amounts of data, applying bespoke machine learning models
as well as hand-written algorithms, ultimately presenting it in an internal web interface.

I worked on most parts of the platform, with emphasis on FE and BFF (backend-for-frontend).

Redis, Neo4J, GCP, Apache Beam, Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, Event Sourcing.

### 2018–2019: [SVT](https://svt.se) – Swedish Public Television

At SVT, I worked with the news product _SVT Nyheter_, built as a server-rendered React
application, hydrated on the client side. With a strict focus on accessibility and
browser compatibility, the site took a load of many hundreds of requests per second,
with spikes of tens of thousands per second.

Technologies included JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, GraphQL, Akamai.

### 2016–2018: [Creuna](https://www.knowit.eu/) – Web agency now acquired by Knowit

At Creuna, I worked in larger teams of developers for the first time, had to learn to use
productivity/collaboration software like JIRA, and to plan my work according to somewhat
agile practices. I mainly worked with PHP, Laravel, JS/TS, Node.js, React.

I worked with companies like [SPP](https://www.spp.se),
[Handelsbanken](https://www.handelsbanken.se), and [AMF Fastigheter](https://www.amffastigheter.se/)
on both smaller and larger sites and projects.

At Kärnhuset, I was hired as a graphic designer, originally as an intern during my
education at [Broby Grafiska](https://brobygrafiska.se); a program I dropped out of
after being offered a position at Kärnhuset. After doing some design work in Adobe software,
I started helping out with development, using languages like JS, TS, PHP, C#, and Dart,
